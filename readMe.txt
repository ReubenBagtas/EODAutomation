Thank you for Demoing my new Automation for EOD

Requirements:
  - Python installed
  - Selenium installed

Before you can start, there are a few things that you need to setup;
please follow instructions on "passw.py" file

Once you finished setup, its time to run the program and just follow 
the instructions below:

1) Open Terminal
2) Navigate To the folder
3) type "python eod.pyc"
4) Enjoy and watch the magic works!!

Note:
-I've compiled the code for security reasons but if you ask nicely I might share my code with you :)

-if you are getting errors, you may have mispelled a few things on 
passw.py file. Please make sure you everything is written in the right format

-If you are still having problems, this automation may not work for you.
But I will continue working on this to make it more robust

-ALSO If you ask nicely, I can also give you my uncompiled code :)

THANKS!! -Ruby
